    <p><b>Main Points from Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML</b></p>
<p><b>How the Web Works</b></p>
<p>The Web is a collection of HTML documents. The language of these documents is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). Software used to interpret these HTML documents into a format that is pleasing to users of the Web is called browsers.</p>
<p>HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used by browsers to request information from servers, computers where HTML and associated files reside.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b></p>
<p>HTML is made up of:</p>
<p>-text content (what you see)<br>-markup (what it looks like)<br>-references to other documents (like images or videos)<br>-links to other pages</p>
<p><b>HTML Markup</b></p>
<p>HTML is composed of elements. These elements are further characterized by tags. Tags assign characteristics or attributes to elements. For example, there are tags that instruct brosers to display text in <b>bold</b> and <em>italics</em>. These tags can be combined and "layered" resulting in text that is both <b><em>bold and italicized</em></b>.</p>
<p>The bold tag in HTML looks like this:<br> [b] contents [/b]<br>where the brackets are replaced by the less than and greater than signs.<br><br>The emphasis tag, aka italicize tag, looks like this:<br>[em]contents[/em]<br>again, where the bracets are replaced by the less than and greater than signs.</p>
<p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>
<p>Some HTML elements contain attributes or language that has a specific function like creating a hyperlink or displaying an image from a file. In general, the format of an HTML element that has an attribute looks like this:<br>[Tag Attr = "value"]contents[/tag]<br>where Tag is the tag name, Attr is the attribute name and value is substituted with a web address or file location among other values.</p>
<p>The anchor tag creates a hyperlink and the general format looks like this:<br>[a href = "www.udacity.com"]practice link[/a]<br><br>The img tag inserts an image from a file location. In general the format looks like this:<br>[img src = "url" alt="text"]<br> where img is the tag name, src is the attribute name, and url is the file location. The last part of the element is used by the browser to display text in case the URL is broken and no image is shown. The text that is displayed can also be used to describe the image and can be of benefit to the visually challenged.</p>
<p><b>Inline and Block elements</b></p>
<p>HTML elements are either inline or block. If they are block, then they have an "invisible block" around them. This is important for formating purposes and will be developed in future stages of this course.</p>
